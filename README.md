# JSPM TypeScript - SASS sample

Sample to demonstrate the usage of the [SystemJS SASS loader plugin](https://github.com/mobilexag/plugin-sass) with TypeScript. This sample was only created as an explanation for [this issue](https://github.com/mobilexag/plugin-sass/issues/25). 

## Running the sample

1. Install jspm packages:

```bash
# If jspm is not installed yet
npm i -g jspm

jspm i
```

2. Serve the directory to your browser. For example:

```bash
# Install browser-sync
npm i -g browser-sync

# Start serving the files and open a browser
browser-sync start --server
```
